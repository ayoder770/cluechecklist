    <h2>Who is Team Gas Aware?</h2>
        
        <p>Team Gas Aware is a Georgia Tech ECE Senior Design Group working with the ATSDR(Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry) and the CDC (Center for Disease Control) to create a more efficient and safer system to detect toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide gas (H<sub>2</sub>S) in the atmosphere.  Currently, human lab technicians are deployed to the field and use their sense of smell to detect toxic gas levels. This method needs to be replaced for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>This method is expensive as lab techs are paid to out to the field, as well as test gas samples that may not produce any valuable results</li>
        <li>Time is wasted going to test areas that may or may not contain dangerous levels of H<sub>2</sub>S</li>
        <li>Safety of the lab technicians is a concern, as well as the inhabitants of the area who may not even be aware there is a toxic level of H<sub>2</sub>S gas around them.</li>
        </ul>
       <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">What Is the Project?</h2>

        <div style="margin-left:20px;" class="half"><p>Team GasAware will be building three sensing units using Arduinos. Each unit will include an H<sub>2</sub>S sensor, a wifi chip, and an LCD screen. The sensor will take readings for H<sub>2</sub>S levels in the atmosphere and will transmit the readings to a server via wifi using the wifi chip. The screen on each unit will display the current reading of H<sub>2</sub>S. One of the three units will contain a gas canister that will take a phsical gas sample when a toxic level of H<sub>2</sub>S is detected by the server. The server will be responsible for alerting a lab tech via text message to go collect the sample and take it to the lab for analysis.
